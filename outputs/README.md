# Director deliverables

Write requested planning and review artifacts under `outputs/<task-id>/`. Keep live coordination state in [short-term memory](../memory/shorterm/README.md); create deliverable files when a handoff or user request benefits from them. For [backlog](../backlog/README.md) tasks, briefs and reviews belong in the iteration folder; use `outputs/` only for final results meant to be kept or shared.

Typical deliverables include a solution comparison, sequenced plan, ready-to-send specialist brief, acceptance review, or consolidated result. An assignment should follow the format in [roles/README.md](../roles/README.md) and include its execution status.

Use descriptive filenames such as `plan.md`, `coding-brief.md`, or `review.md` when those artifacts are requested. Link to specialist source changes in their own workspace rather than copying source code into a report. Store Blender assets, renders, exports, or personal-assistant artifacts at the destinations specified in their assignment, and link to them from the review.

Every acceptance review should state what was checked, the supporting evidence, unresolved issues, and the next action. Label pending dispatch and unavailable verification explicitly. A proposed plan or prepared brief is not evidence of execution.

Generated deliverables are ignored by Git by default. Intentionally add only artifacts the project needs to version. Keep credentials and raw private account data out of reports; include only context required for the authorized task.
